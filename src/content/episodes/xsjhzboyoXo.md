    Since the We Comin For You Cast Has been growing R8ted R wants to discontinue the Jon Jones Freedom Memorial Award because of a chance encounter with Jon Jones himself. But it can't be stopped it is too late. R8Ted R forgot the internet has receipts. Oh but the award this edition goes to Teddy Hart.
