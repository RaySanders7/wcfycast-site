longDescription: >-
    We Comin For You discuss the concept of having too much money and the potential consequences it can bring. They explore the idea of an idle mind being the devil's playground and how having unlimited financial resources can lead to indulgence and reckless behavior. The hosts also touch on the topic of P. Diddy and his influence on various aspects of life, including gas prices and hip hop. They then bring in the possibility of Vince McMahon being at the Diddy "freak off" parties. They finally speculate about lifestyle and the persona of "The Rock" in wrestling.
