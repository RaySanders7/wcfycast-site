longDescription: >-
    Jade Cargill has been in confrontation with Bow Wow aka Shad Moss for the last few weeks and their "altercation" at Bow Wow's scream tour date brought the We Comin For You Wrestling Cast ( @WeCominForYouWrestlingCast ) back from hiatus. This Jade Cargill vs Bow Wow couldn't really be a thing happening in AEW or could it??
